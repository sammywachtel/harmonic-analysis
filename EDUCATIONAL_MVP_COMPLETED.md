## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### Quick Demo Test

```bash
cd /Users/samwachtel/PycharmProjects/harmonic-analysis

# Beginner level
PYTHONPATH=src python demo/full_library_demo.py \
  --key "C major" \
  --profile classical \
  --chords "Dm G7 C" \
  --explain beginner

# Intermediate level
PYTHONPATH=src python demo/full_library_demo.py \
  --key "C major" \
  --profile classical \
  --chords "Dm G7 C" \
  --explain intermediate

# Advanced level
PYTHONPATH=src python demo/full_library_demo.py \
  --key "C major" \
  --profile classical \
  --chords "Dm G7 C" \
  --explain advanced
```

### Run Test Suite

```bash
# All educational tests
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/educational/ -v

# Specific test classes
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/educational/test_knowledge_base.py::TestKnowledgeBase -v
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/educational/test_knowledge_base.py::TestEducationalService -v
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/educational/test_knowledge_base.py::TestEducationalFormatter -v
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from harmonic_analysis.educational import (
    EducationalService,
    EducationalFormatter,
    LearningLevel,
)

service = EducationalService()

# Explain a pattern
context = service.explain_pattern(
    "cadence.authentic.perfect",
    LearningLevel.BEGINNER
)

# Format for display
formatter = EducationalFormatter()
print(formatter.format_text(context))

# Get practice suggestions
suggestions = service.generate_practice_suggestions(
    ["cadence.authentic.perfect", "functional.ii_V_I"],
    LearningLevel.INTERMEDIATE
)

# Create learning path
path = service.create_learning_path("cadence.authentic.perfect")
```

## ðŸ“Š What This Enables

### Before (Technical Output Only)
```
Type           : functional
Confidence     : 0.899
Key            : C major
Roman Numerals : ii, V7, I

Evidence:
- Pattern: cadence.authentic.perfect (Weight: 0.95)
```

### After (With Educational Content)

**Beginner Level:**
```
âœ¨ What it is:
   The strongest way to end a musical phrase...

ðŸŽµ Key Points:
   â€¢ Uses V â†’ I chords (the most powerful progression)
   â€¢ Both chords in strongest position (root position)
   â€¢ Melody ends on the home note (scale degree 1)

ðŸ”‘ Why it matters:
   The satisfying 'resolved' feeling at phrase endings

ðŸŽ¼ Musical Examples:
   â€¢ Phrase ending: G7 â†’ C (C major)
   â€¢ Section boundary: D7 â†’ G (G major)
```

**Intermediate Level:**
```
ðŸŽ“ Theory Overview:
   Perfect Authentic Cadence - V to I with soprano on tonic...

ðŸŽ“ Essential Concepts:
   â€¢ Root position requirement for both V and I
   â€¢ Soprano must end on scale degree 1 (tonic)
   â€¢ Creates strongest harmonic closure
   â€¢ "Perfect" vs "Imperfect" distinction

ðŸŽ“ Musical Significance:
   Foundational cadence type in functional harmony...

ðŸŽµ Musical Examples:
   â€¢ Classical period: Haydn, Symphony 94 finale
   â€¢ Baroque chorale: Bach, BWV 253
```

## ðŸ’¡ Validation Questions for Next Session

1. **Does the educational content help you learn?**
   - Try the different learning levels
   - Is the progression from beginner â†’ intermediate â†’ advanced clear?
   - Are the explanations helpful or confusing?

2. **What patterns should we prioritize next?**
   - Of the remaining 7 priority patterns, which would be most useful?
   - Are there other patterns you'd want educational content for?

3. **What's missing from the current content?**
   - Do you want more musical examples?
   - Are the practice suggestions actionable?
   - Should we add audio/visual references?

4. **Is the demo integration intuitive?**
   - Is the `--explain` flag discoverable?
   - Should educational content be displayed differently?
   - Would you prefer HTML output instead of plain text?

**Test it out and let me know what works and what doesn't!** ðŸŽµ
