Music file processing for MIDI and MusicXML files.

Handles file upload and processing workflow:
- Parse MIDI/MusicXML files using music21
- Detect tempo and calculate analysis window size
- Chordify (extract chord reduction from multi-part scores)
- Label chords with symbols
- Track measures and offsets
- Export to MusicXML and PNG notation
- Integrate with harmonic analysis engine

This module provides the core file processing functions for the demo's
music file upload feature.

    Process uploaded MusicXML/MIDI file with optional chordify and analysis.

    This function provides music21 integration by:
    1. Parsing uploaded files (MusicXML or MIDI)
    2. Optionally using music21's chordify to extract chord reduction
    3. Detecting chords using the library's chord detection
    4. Generating PNG notation and MusicXML download
    5. Optionally running harmonic analysis on extracted chords

    Opening move: Validate file and set up parsing with warning capture.
    The file parsing can generate lots of warnings about MIDI import quirks,
    so we filter and present only musically relevant warnings to users.

    Main play: Chordify the score if requested. This is the big one - we use
    adaptive windowing to detect chord changes, then split at measure boundaries
    to match musical notation conventions. Each chord gets labeled with symbols.

    Victory lap: Export the annotated score to MusicXML and optionally run
    harmonic analysis on the extracted chord progression.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to uploaded file (.xml, .mxl, .mid, .midi)
        add_chordify: Whether to add chordify staff to score
        label_chords: Whether to add chord symbol labels
        run_analysis: Whether to run harmonic analysis on chords
        profile: Analysis profile (classical, jazz, pop, etc.)
        process_full_file: Whether to process entire file (vs first 20 measures)
        auto_window: Whether to auto-calculate window size from tempo
        manual_window_size: Manual window size in quarter lengths (if auto_window=False)
        key_mode_preference: "Major" or "Minor" for key signature interpretation

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing:
            - chord_symbols: List of detected chord symbols
            - chordified_symbols_with_measures: Chords with measure numbers
            - key_hint: Detected key signature
            - metadata: File metadata (title, composer, etc.)
            - notation_url: Path to generated PNG notation
            - download_url: Path to annotated MusicXML file
            - analysis_result: Optional analysis results
            - measure_count: Total measures in score
            - truncated_for_display: Whether notation was truncated
            - is_midi: Flag for MIDI warning display
            - parsing_logs: Parsing logs and warnings
            - window_size_used: Window size used for chord detection

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If file format unsupported or parsing fails
        RuntimeError: If Lilypond is not installed (required for PNG generation)
