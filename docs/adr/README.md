# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Ensuring Consistency and Upholding Design Patterns

To maintain consistent design patterns across the codebase, we adopt a structured approach that integrates documentation, automated validation, and continuous feedback. This involves documenting architectural decisions through ADRs, enforcing coding standards and schema validations via linting and tests, and embedding these checks into the continuous integration pipeline. Pull request templates guide contributors to follow established patterns, ensuring alignment and quality throughout development.

## Detailed Process for Upholding Design Patterns

1. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):**
   All significant architectural choices are recorded as ADRs. These documents clearly describe the decision, context, and consequences, providing a single source of truth for design patterns and rationale.

2. **Linting and Static Analysis:**
   Automated linters are configured to enforce coding standards and detect deviations from agreed-upon patterns. This step catches inconsistencies early in the development cycle.

3. **Schema Validation:**
   JSON schemas or equivalent are used to validate configuration files, data structures, and API contracts. This ensures conformity to expected formats and design constraints.

4. **Meta-Tests:**
   Specialized tests verify that the testing infrastructure itself is correctly set up and that tests cover the intended scenarios related to design patterns.

5. **Golden Tests:**
   Golden files are maintained to capture expected outputs or states. Tests compare current outputs against these golden files to detect unintended changes in implementation or design adherence.

6. **Continuous Integration (CI):**
   All checks—linting, schema validation, meta-tests, and golden tests—are integrated into the CI pipeline. This guarantees that any violation of design patterns or regressions are caught before code merges.

7. **Pull Request (PR) Templates:**
   PR templates include reminders and checklists related to design patterns and ADR compliance. Contributors are prompted to reference relevant ADRs and ensure their changes align with established patterns.

By following this comprehensive process, the project maintains architectural integrity, reduces technical debt, and fosters a shared understanding of design principles among contributors.
