# Generated Test Files

This directory contains test files that are automatically generated during test runs.

## Files Generated:
- `comprehensive-multi-layer-tests.json`: Generated by `scripts/generate_comprehensive_multi_layer_tests.py`
- `comprehensive-multi-layer-tests.csv`: CSV export of the comprehensive test cases
- Other dynamic test case files as needed

## Note:
These files are excluded from git tracking (see `.gitignore`) because they:
1. Are regenerated with each test run
2. May vary based on system configuration
3. Contain large amounts of generated data that don't need version control

The generation script ensures these files exist when needed for testing.
