"""
Modern baseline validation test for 4-stage calibration system.

This module tests the complete calibration pipeline integration with real baseline data.
Unlike the legacy test_confidence_against_baseline.py which uses simple affine transforms,
this validates our sophisticated 4-stage calibration system:

1. Stage 1 - Platt Scaling: Sigmoid calibration mapping raw scores to probabilities
2. Stage 2 - Isotonic Regression: Non-parametric monotonic calibration refinement
3. Stage 3 - Bucket Routing: Feature-based routing to specialized calibration models
4. Stage 4 - Uncertainty Learning: Final confidence adjustment with learned uncertainty

The tests validate that calibrated confidence scores fall within acceptable tolerance
ranges compared to music-theory expert baselines, ensuring our calibration system
produces theoretically sound results across different harmonic analysis contexts.

Key Test Categories:
- Baseline validation against expert-curated dataset
- Direct comparison of calibrated vs uncalibrated results
- Per-analysis-type performance validation (functional vs modal)
- Tolerance and error threshold validation

This complements (doesn't replace) test_confidence_against_baseline.py which serves
as a simpler regression test for basic confidence scoring behavior.
