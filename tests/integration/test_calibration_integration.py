"""
Test CalibrationService integration with PatternAnalysisService.

This module validates the complete integration between our 4-stage CalibrationService
and the PatternAnalysisService. Unlike baseline validation tests that focus on accuracy,
these tests ensure the technical integration works correctly:

Key Integration Points Tested:
1. Dependency Injection: CalibrationService properly injected into PatternAnalysisService
2. Feature Extraction: Analysis features correctly extracted for calibration routing
3. Calibration Application: Raw confidence scores properly calibrated using 4-stage pipeline
4. Alternative Results: Calibration applied to both primary and alternative analyses
5. Error Handling: Graceful degradation when calibration fails or is misconfigured
6. Async Operations: Calibration works correctly in async analysis workflows

The tests cover both manual calibration service injection and automatic calibration
scenarios, ensuring flexibility for different usage patterns.

Test Categories:
- Basic integration setup and dependency injection
- Calibration application to analysis results
- Comparison between calibrated vs uncalibrated analysis
- Alternative result calibration
- Various progression types and edge cases
- Logging and observability of calibration actions
- Error handling and graceful degradation
