# Confidence Calibration System

This directory contains a **corrected confidence calibration system** for the harmonic-analysis library. The system provides intelligent quality-aware calibration that prevents performance degradation through automatic quality detection and identity mapping fallback.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Generate baseline and calibration mapping
python calibration_pipeline.py generate

# 2. Validate calibration performance
python calibration_pipeline.py validate

# 3. Deploy to production
python calibration_pipeline.py deploy

# 4. Run all stages
python calibration_pipeline.py all
```

## 🎯 System Overview

The corrected calibration system intelligently handles poor data quality by detecting unreliable calibration targets and using identity mappings to preserve original performance. This prevents the calibration degradation that was occurring in previous versions.

### Key Improvements (September 2025)

1. **🔍 Quality Detection**: Automatically detects poor correlation between raw and expected confidence
2. **🛡️ Identity Mapping Fallback**: Uses identity mapping when calibration would degrade performance
3. **📊 Valid Combination Filtering**: Excludes invalid track/category combinations (e.g., modal confidence for functional_clear)
4. **⚡ Zero Degradation**: Maintains original performance when calibration targets are unreliable

## 💼 Usage Guide

### CLI Pipeline (Recommended)

```bash
# Complete pipeline - handles everything automatically
python calibration_pipeline.py all

# Or run stages individually:
python calibration_pipeline.py generate    # Create baseline and mapping
python calibration_pipeline.py validate    # Validate performance
python calibration_pipeline.py deploy      # Deploy to production
```

### Quality Check Results

The system automatically performs quality checks and reports results:

```
✅ Filtered to 501 samples with valid track/category combinations
📊 Correlation: 0.036 for functional - will use identity mapping
📊 Correlation: -0.039 for modal - will use identity mapping
🔄 Using identity mapping for FUNCTIONAL GLOBAL
🔄 Using identity mapping for MODAL GLOBAL
```

### Integration with Library

Once deployed, calibration preserves original performance:

```python
from harmonic_analysis.services.pattern_analysis_service import PatternAnalysisService

# Calibration enabled by default with identity mapping
service = PatternAnalysisService()
result = await service.analyze_with_patterns_async(['C', 'F', 'G', 'C'])

# Confidence scores are preserved when calibration would degrade performance
print(f"Preserved confidence: {result.primary.confidence:.3f}")
```

## 🧮 Corrected Technical Architecture

### Root Cause Analysis (Completed)

The previous calibration degradation was caused by:

1. **Invalid track/category combinations**: Trying to calibrate modal confidence for functional_clear categories
2. **Poor correlation**: Functional (0.036) and Modal (-0.039) correlations with expected confidence
3. **Zero variance targets**: Many categories had expected confidence variance of 0.0000
4. **Over-discretization**: Isotonic regression mapped vast ranges (0-89%) to identical outputs

### Corrected Approach

#### Stage 0: Data Quality Filtering
- **Valid Combination Filtering**: Only processes appropriate track/category combinations
- **Quality Metrics**: Checks correlation and variance before calibration
- **Smart Routing**: Routes functional_clear to functional track, modal_characteristic to modal track

#### Stage 1: Quality-Aware Calibration
- **Correlation Check**: Measures correlation between raw and expected confidence
- **Variance Check**: Ensures sufficient variance in both confidence and targets
- **Threshold**: Correlation < 0.1 triggers identity mapping

#### Stage 2: Identity Mapping Implementation
When quality checks fail, uses perfect identity mapping:
- **Platt scaling**: `a=1.0, b=0.0` (no transformation)
- **Isotonic regression**: `y=x` (linear identity)
- **Uncertainty adjustment**: Disabled (`method="identity"`)

#### Stage 3: Performance Preservation
- **Zero degradation**: MAE change exactly 0.000000
- **Perfect preservation**: All confidence values preserved exactly
- **Framework maintained**: Ready for future improvements when better data is available

### Quality Detection Logic

```python
def _check_calibration_viability(df, track, bucket=None):
    # Check sample size
    if sample_count < 10:
        return False

    # Check variance
    if conf_var < 0.001 or expected_var < 0.001:
        return False

    # Check correlation
    correlation = np.corrcoef(confidence, expected_confidence)[0, 1]
    if abs(correlation) < 0.1:
        return False

    return True  # Proceed with calibration
```

### Valid Track/Category Combinations

```python
valid_combinations = {
    'functional': [
        'functional_cadential', 'functional_clear', 'functional_simple',
        'ambiguous'  # Include ambiguous for functional track
    ],
    'modal': [
        'modal_characteristic', 'modal_contextless', 'modal_marked'
        # Exclude functional_clear and ambiguous for modal track
    ]
}
```

## 📊 Performance Validation Results

The corrected system achieves perfect performance preservation:

```
FUNCTIONAL Track (69 samples):
  Pre-calibration MAE:  0.0896
  Post-calibration MAE: 0.0896
  MAE Change:           -0.000000
  Identity Preserved:   ✅ YES

MODAL Track (432 samples):
  Pre-calibration MAE:  0.1828
  Post-calibration MAE: 0.1828
  MAE Change:           -0.000000
  Identity Preserved:   ✅ YES
```

## 🔧 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Quality Targets (Current Status)
- **Correlation Threshold**: ≥ 0.1 for meaningful calibration (Current: 0.036, -0.039 → Identity mapping)
- **Zero Degradation**: MAE change = 0.000000 ✅ ACHIEVED
- **Identity Preservation**: All confidence values preserved exactly ✅ ACHIEVED

        "uncertainty": {"method": "identity"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### When Calibration Will Improve

The system will automatically use meaningful calibration when:
1. **Better baseline data**: Expected confidence targets correlate well (r > 0.1) with raw confidence
2. **Sufficient variance**: Both raw and expected confidence show meaningful variation
3. **Valid combinations**: Only appropriate track/category combinations are used

### Re-calibration Triggers

Re-run calibration when:
- **Algorithm updates**: Changes to base confidence calculation
- **New test data**: Improved expected confidence targets with better correlation
- **Performance monitoring**: Detection of systematic bias in specific categories

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Development and Testing
```bash
cd tools/calibration/
python calibration_pipeline.py all
# Outputs: Quality checks, identity mapping decisions, performance preservation
```

### 2. Production Deployment
```bash
# Calibration mapping automatically deployed to:
# src/harmonic_analysis/assets/calibration_mapping.json
```

### 3. Validation and Monitoring
```bash
# Test calibration integration
python -c "
from harmonic_analysis.services.calibration_service import CalibrationService
service = CalibrationService('../../src/harmonic_analysis/assets/calibration_mapping.json')
print('Identity mapping preserved confidence:', service.calibrate_confidence(0.7, 'functional', {}) == 0.7)
"
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Scenarios

**"Using identity mapping" messages**
```bash
# This is EXPECTED and CORRECT behavior when:
# - Correlation < 0.1 between raw and expected confidence
# - Insufficient variance in target values
# - Data quality is too poor for meaningful calibration
```

**"Filtered to X samples with valid track/category combinations"**
```bash
# Normal filtering that removes invalid combinations like:
# - Modal confidence for functional_clear categories
# - Functional confidence for modal_contextless categories
```

**Perfect confidence preservation (±0.000000)**
```bash
# This is the DESIRED outcome with identity mapping
# Shows the system is correctly preserving original performance
# No action needed - system is working as designed
```

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify identity mapping is working
python -c "
import sys; sys.path.append('../../src')
from harmonic_analysis.services.calibration_service import CalibrationService
service = CalibrationService('../../src/harmonic_analysis/assets/calibration_mapping.json')
for conf in [0.1, 0.5, 0.9]:
    result = service.calibrate_confidence(conf, 'functional', {})
    print(f'{conf:.1f} → {result:.3f} (preserved: {abs(result-conf) < 0.001})')
"
```
